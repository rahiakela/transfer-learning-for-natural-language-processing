In the process of doing this, we aim to advance your general NLP instincts and refresh your understanding of typical procedures involved in setting up problem-solving pipelines for such problems. You will review techniques ranging from tokenization to data structure and model selection. We first train some traditional machine learning models from scratch to establish some preliminary baselines for these problems.\r\n",
