        "In this notebook, we will cover some prominent shallow transfer learning approaches and concepts. This allows us to explore some major themes in transfer learning, while doing so in the context of relatively simple models of the class of eventual interest, i.e., shallow neural networks.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Roughly speaking, categorization is based on whether transfer occurs between different languages, tasks or data domains. Each of these types of categorization is usually correspondingly referred to as cross-lingual learning, multi-task learning and domain adaptation.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The methods we will look at here will involve components that are neural networks in one way or another.these neural networks do not have many\r\n",
        "layers. This is the reason why the label “shallow” is appropriate to describe this collection of methods.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A common form of semi-supervised learning that employs pretrained word embeddings such as word2vec that they produce a single vector per word, regardless of context.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We revisit the IMDB movie review sentiment classification. Recall that this example is concerned with classifying movie reviews from IMDB into positive or negative sentiments expressed. It is a prototypical sentiment analysis example that has been used widely in the literature to study many algorithms. We combine feature vectors generated by pretrained word embeddings for each review with some traditional machine learning classification methods, namely random forests and logistic regression.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We then demonstrate that using higher-level embeddings which vectorize bigger sections of text – such as at the sentence-level, paragraphlevel and document-level – can lead to improved performance. The general idea of vectorizing text and then applying a traditional machine learning classification method to the resulting vectors.\r\n",

        "**Multi-task learning**\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Subsequently, we introduce the reader to multi-task learning. We demonstrate how one can train a single system simultaneously to perform multiple tasks, email spam classification and IMDB movie review sentiment analysis. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There are several potential benefits to multi-task learning. By\r\n",
        "training a single machine learning model for multiple tasks, a shared representation is learned on a larger and more varied collection of data from the combined data pool, which can lead to performance improvements. Moreover, it has been widely observed that this shared representation has a better ability to generalize to tasks beyond those that were trained on, and\r\n",
        "this improvement can be achieved without any increase in model size.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Specifically, we focus on shallow neural multitask learning, where a single additional dense layer, as well as a classification layer, is trained\r\n",
        "for each specific task in the setup. Different tasks also share a layer between them, a setup typically referred to as hard-parameter sharing.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "**Domain adaptation**\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Assume that we are given one source domain, which can be defined as a particular distribution of data for a specific task, and a classifier that has been trained to perform well on data in that domain for that task. The goal of domain adaptation is to modify, or adapt, data in a different target domain in such a way that the pretrained knowledge from the source domain can aid\r\n",
        "learning in the target domain. We apply a simple autoencoding approach to “project” samples in the target domain into the source domain feature space.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "An autoencoder is a system that learns to reconstruct inputs with very high accuracy, typically by encoding them into an efficient latent representation and learning to decode the said representation efficiently. They have traditionally been heavily used in model reduction applications, since the latent representation is often of smaller dimension than the original space\r\n",
        "from which the encoding happens, and the said dimension value can also be picked to strike the right balance of computational efficiency and accuracy.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In the extreme scenario, improvements can be obtained with no labelled data in the target domain being used for training. This is typically referred to as zero-shot domain adaptation, where learning happens with no labeled\r\n",
